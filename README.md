# RubikCube

In this project, we create a 3D Rubik's cube using OpenGL and C++. The cube has six faces, each consisting of nine colored squares. The goal is to scramble the cube and then solve it by restoring each face to a single color.

## To achieve this, we implement various features

- User can rotate the cube along the x, y, and z axes and freely move it with the mouse pointer for different viewing angles.
- The user can change the rotation speed of the cube's sides.
- Keyboard controls are provided for users to rotate each side of the cube.
- There's an option to reshuffle and reset the cube, along with a timer and scoring system. The score decreases as the solving time increases.

## Objectives
- The Rubik’s Cube is a 3D puzzle with six faces of nine colored squares, challenging and captivating for decades.
- Create a virtual Rubik’s Cube game for users to play on their computers.
- Allow users to interact with the 3D cube, scramble it, and solve it.
- Provide a graphical interface for learning and improving solving strategies.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Software requirements
- CodeBlocks IDE or similar with a C/C++ compiler.

- Rotation controls for X, Y, and Z axes.
- Adjustable rotation speed (decrease or increase).
- User controls for shuffling and resetting the cube.
- Timer functionality.
- Scoring system.
